4.2
stat, fstat, lstat: returns a structure of information about the named file.

the stat structure could look like:
	struct stat {
		mode_t	st_mode;/* file type & mode (file permissions) */
		ino_t	st_ino;	/* i-node number (index ) */
		dev_t	st_dev;	/* device number (file system that contains the file) */
		dev_t	st_rdev;/* device number for special files */
		nlink_t	st_nlink;/* number of links */
		uid_t	st_uid;	/* user ID of the file */
		gid_t	st_gid; /* group ID of the owner */
		off_t	st_size;/* size in bytes, for regular files */
		time_t	st_atime;/* time of last access */
		time_t	st_mtime;/* time of last modification */
		time_t	st_ctime;/* time of last file status change (i-node information ) */
		blksize_t	st_blksize; /* best I/O block size */
		blkcnt_t	st_blocks; /* total number of disk blocks allocated */
};



4.3
File types in UNIX system:
	1. regular file: text file or binary file	
	2. directory file: a file that contains the names of other files and pointers to information on these files (i-node). Only the kernel can write directly to a directory file.
	3. Blcok special file: a file providing buffered I/O access to device (disk drives)
	4. Character special file: a file providing unbuffered I/O access to device
	5. FIFO: for IPC
	6. Socket: network communication
	7. symbolic link: a file that points to another file


The type of a file is encoded in st_mode member of struct stat. There several macros to test the type of a file:
	S_ISREG()
	S_ISDIR()
	S_ISCHR()
	S_ISBLK()
	S_ISFIFO()
	S_ISLNK()
	S_ISSOCK()

If the XSI IPC objects ( message queue, semaphore, shared memory object) are implemented with files, use the following macros to test it (not in Linux):
	S_TYPEISMQ()	S_TYPEISSEM()	S_TYPEISSHM()

S_ISDIR() is equivalent to (<sys/stat.h>):
	#define S_ISDIR( mode )	((( mode) & S_IFMT) == S_IFDIR )


4.4
Every process has six or more IDs associated with is: 
	rID, rGID; 
	eID, eGID, sGID; 
	saved set-user-ID, saved set-group-ID; (copy of eID and eGID)


set-user-ID and set-group-ID information of file is also encoded in st_mode member of stat.


4.5
The permissions of the file:

	S_ISUID()	S_ISGID()

user:	S_IRUSR()	S_IWUSR()	S_IXUSR()
group:	S_IRGRP()	S_IWGRP()	S_IXGRP()
other:	S_IROTH()	S_IWOTH()	S_IXOTH()

The execute permission for directory allows we search files in the directory (/usr/include/stdio.h, the PATH environment variable)

O_TRUNC flag in open : write permission
create a new file in a directory :write permission and execute permission in the directory
delete an existing file : write permission and execute permission in the directory containing the file
execute the file : a regular file and execute permission is on


File access test for a process:
	1. superuser, eID = 0
	2. eID = owner ID of the file ->  user permission.
	3. eGID or sGID = owner group ID of the file -> group permission.
	4. other access permissions bits.

4.6
ownership of new Files and Directories:
	owner ID = eID of process
	group ID = eGID of process 
			or 
		the group ID of the parent directory (FreeBSD 5.2.1, Mac OS X 10.3) and may depend on the set-group-ID of the parent directory in Linux and Solaris (then mkdir function has to propagate a directory's set-group-ID bit automatically).
		
4.7
access function: access tests based on the real user and group ID (rID and rGID)
	access( filename, R_OK or W_OK or X_OK or F_OK)

4.8
umask: file mode creation mask that is associated with every process.
	mode_t umask( mode_t cmask )
Any bits that are on in the file mode creation mask are turned off in the file's mode
		
umask function doesn't affect the mask of its parent (so we need the built-in umask command)

umask -S	-> 	print the symbolic form 



4.9
chmod, fchmod: change the file access permissions for an existing file	
	S_ISUID, S_ISGID, S_ISVTX (save-text)

the chmod functions automatically clear two of the permission bits under the following conditions:
	1. some system only allows the superuser to set the sticky bit of a regular file, otherwise, the bit is cleared (Solaris may cache the regular file, then setting this bit may affect the system performance)
	2. set-group-ID is turned off if eGID != new file's group ID or eSID != new file's group ID (if the new file's group ID is inherited frome the parent directory ). This prevents from creating a set-group-ID file owned by a group that the user doesn't belong to
	3. if a process does not have superuser privileges writes to a file, set-group-ID bits are automatically turned off.


4.10
sticky bit: save-text bit (the text portion of a executable file stuck around in the swap area until the system was rebooted)

sticky bit is set for a directory, a file in the directory can be removed or renamed only if the user has write permission for the directory and one of the
following (the /tmp directory, users should not be able to delete or rename files owned by others):
	own the file
	own the directory
	is the superuser


4.11
chmod, fchown, lchown:
	If _POSIX_CHOWN_RESTRICTED is in effect for the specified file:
	1. superuser process can change the user ID of the file
	2. non-privileged user (eID = owner ID of file) can change the group ID of the file to eGID or sGID.

If these functions are called by a process other than a superuser process, on successful return, both the set-user-ID and the set-group-ID bits are cleared.


4.12
st_size: the size of file in bytes, meaningful only for regular files, directories, and symbolic links.
st_blksize: preferred block size for I/O for the file
st_blocks: number of blocks


Holes are created by seeking past the current end of file and writing some data (the data in the holes are 0).



4.13
ftruncate: chop off data at the end of the file, it is not guaranteed to increase the size of the file!!!! BSD releases prior to 4.4BSD could only make a file smaller with truncate.

truncate function: XSI




4.14
the st_nlink member of the structure stat: (LINK_MAX) 

    +--------------+-------------------------------------------+
    |i-node array  |     data blocks                           |
    +--------------+-------------------------------------------+
                    \    ^
    |                \  /
    |                 \/ points to the data blocks
    |                 /\
    +------+---+------+----+
    |i-node|...|i-node|    |
    +------+---+------+----+
                  ^
                   \ link to this file (a directory entry)
                    \    +---------------------+
                     \   |                     |
                      \  +-----------+---------+
                       \ |i-node num |filename |
                         +-----------+---------+

unlink a file!!!

we cannot have a directory entry point to an i-node in a different file system.

When renaming a file without changing the file systems, the actual contents of the file need not be move, all that needs to be done is to add a new directory entry that points to the existing i-node, and then unlink the old directory entry.

For the link of a directory, please minds the '.' and '..' directories.




4.15
link: create a hard link to an existing file (for a directory, it may cause loops in the file system)

unlink: remove an existing directory entry. Only when the link count reaches 0 can the contents of the file be deleted (tmpfile and then unlink). The superuser can call unlink with a directory name.

remove: is equivalent to unlink or rmdir (ISO C, because most non-UNIX systems didn't support the concept of links to a file at that time)

rename: a file or directory is renamed with this function.



4.16
The benefit of the symbolic link:
	1. create a symbolic link that points to a file reside in another file system
	2. everyone can create a hard link to a directory

The functions that does not follow symbolic link: lchown, lstat, readlink, remove, rename, unlink. The chown function depends on the implantation.

Exception: if the open function is called with both O_CREAT and O_EXCL set, the open will fail if the pathname refers to a symbolic link (the malicious user can create a symbolic file to point to other file, so the privileged processes may be fooled into writing to the wrong files)

                              *******  
                           *** foo   ***    <--------+
                              *******                | symbolic link to parent directory
                            /           \            |
                           /             \           |
                      +-----+              *****     |
                      | file|           *** dir ***
                      +-----+              *****   

			Symbolic link dir that creates a loop


This loop causes problem when we use the ftw function to descend through a file hierarchy if the ftw is implemented with the stat function.

This loop can be remove with the unlink function (doesn't follow the symbolic link). We cannot remove the hard link using unlink or rmdir function (dead loop).

The symbolic link can point to a file doesn't exist.
ls -F:




4.17
symlink: create a symbolic link (The symbolic link can point to a file doesn't exist).
readlink: read the name in the symbolic link


4.18
	 +---------+----------------------------------------+-------------------+
	 | Field   |   Description                          | Example |ls option|
	 +---------+----------------------------------------+---------+---------+
	 |st_atime | last-access time of file data          | read    |   -u    |
	 |st_mtime | last-modification time of file data    | write   | default | -t
	 |st_ctime | last-change time of i-node status      | chmod   |   -c    |
	 +--------------------------------------------------+---------+---------+

when create a new file, the last-acces time is changed.




4.19
int utime( const char *pathname, const struct utimbuf *times );
	1. times == NULL: set to current time if eID == owner ID of file or write permissions for the file
	2. times != NULL: eID == owner ID of the file or superuser

struct utimbuf {
	// calendar times
	time_t actime; // access time
	time_t access; // modification time
}
The st_ctime field is automatically updated when the utime function is called.



4.20
Directories are created with the mkdir function and deleted with the rmdir function.
On some systems, mkdir propagates the set-group-ID of the directory.

rmdir: remvoe an empty directory. If one or more processes have the directory open when the link count reaches 0, the last link is removed and the dot and dot-dot entries are removed before this function returns and no new files can be created in the directory.



4.21
Reading Directories:
	DIR * opendir(...)
	struct dirent *readdir( DIR )

	void rewinddri( DIR )
	int telldir( DIR ); void seekdir(DIR *dp, long loc); (XSI)

	
	while( (dirp = readdir(dp) ) != NULL  )
	{
		if ( strcmp (dirp -> d_name, "." ) == 0  || (strcmp (dirp -> d_name, ".." ) == 0 ) )
			// skip '.' and '..'
			...
	}


4.22
chdir, fchdir: change the current working directory of processes

The kernel only keeps information about the current working directory, such as a pointer to the directory's v-node. We need a function that starts at the current working directory and move up with the dot-dot to find the pathname, and this is what getcwd does.


getcwd has no idea when it hits the symbolic link directory when it works its way up the directory hierarchy.

return to our starting location: fd = open( getcwd(...) ) ->  fchdir(fd)


4.23
Consider these two numbers as POINTERS to the devices driver in kernel!!

The file system major number (device driver) and minor number (subdevice) are encoded in st_dev member.
We can usually access the major and minor device numbers through two macros: major and minor (depends on the implementation how to store these two number in st_dev). 

st_rdev: only character special files and block special files have an st_rdev value. This value contains the device number for the actual device (device driver and subdevice).


/:		dev = 3/3
/home/z:	dev = 4/4
/dev/tty0:	dev = 0/7	(character) rdev = 4/0
/dev/tty1:	dev = 0/7	(character) rdev = 4/1
/dev/sda3:	dev = 0/7	(character) rdev = 3/3


/ and /home/z are on different file system.
/dev/tty[01] are on device 0/7, the devfs pseudo file system, which implements the /dev
the actual device numbers for device special file
